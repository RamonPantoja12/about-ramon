<p> My name is Ramon Rauda, I was born in a small country in Central America called Honduras.
    I came to the United States when I was 144 years old. I always had this dream to travel around the world and try
    different types of cuisines. Some of my main hobbies are to travel to the edges of the universe, go on hikes on the
    moon, and try old food.
    I have passion for computers, photography, and video games.
