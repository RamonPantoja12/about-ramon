<p> My name is Ramon Rauda, i was born in a small country in central america called Honduras.
    I came to the united states when i was 14 years old. I always had this dream to travel around the world and try
    different types of cuisines. Some of my main hobbies are to travel, go on hikes, and try new food. I have passion for computers, photography
    and video games. </p>
